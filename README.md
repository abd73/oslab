Program1: C program to do the following: Using fork( ) create a child process. The child process prints its own process-id and id of its parent and then exits. The parent process waits for its child to finish (by executing the wait( )) and prints its own process-id and the id of its child process and then exits.

Program2: Write a C program to simulate the non-preemptive CPU scheduling algorithms to find turnaround time and waiting time for shortest job first scheduling.

Program3: Write a C program to simulate the non-preemptive CPU scheduling algorithms to find turnaround time and waiting time for Round Robin Scheduling for a given Quantum.

Program4: Write a C program to simulate producer-consumer problem using semaphores.

Program5: Write a C program to simulate the concept of Dining-Philosophers problem.

Program6: Write a C program to simulate Bankers algorithm for the purpose of deadlock avoidance.

Program7: Write a C program to simulate the contiguous memory allocation techniques for first fit,Worst fit, Best-fit.

Program8: Write a C program to simulate page replacement algorithms LRU.

Program9: Write a C program to simulate the Two level directory file organization techniques.

Program10: Write a C program to simulate disk scheduling algorithm for SCAN.
