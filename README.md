Program1: C program to do the following: Using fork( ) create a child process. The child process prints its own process-id and id of its parent and then exits. The parent process waits for its child to finish (by executing the wait( )) and prints its own process-id and the id of its child process and then exits.

Program2: Write a C program to simulate the non-preemptive CPU scheduling algorithms to find turnaround time and waiting time for shortest job first scheduling.

Program3: Write a C program to simulate the non-preemptive CPU scheduling algorithms to find turnaround time and waiting time for Round Robin Scheduling for a given Quantum.
